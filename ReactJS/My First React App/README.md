# My First React App

The structure is as follows:
| HelloWorld.js 
| App.js
| index.js

## HelloWorld.js
Creates the component which displays text on the page.

## App.js
Most apps have this, it will combine all the components into a centralized ```<App />``` component.

## index.js
Calls the ReactDOM and renders the app.
