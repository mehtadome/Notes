# The Rock Fitness Store
This project was created alongside the Pluralsight course **Managing State in React 18** by Cory House.

The application is an example of advanced state management in plain React. It covers:
- Routing
- Forms
- Complex state with ```useContext```

There is also a special folder **Utilizing 3rd Party Libraries** which shows code of working with different ones.

## Build the project
To build the application, ```cd``` into **Rock Fitness Store** and run ```npm install```. When the application is installed, run ```npm build```.
