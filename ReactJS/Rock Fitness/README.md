# The Rock Fitness Store
This project was created alongside the Pluralsight course **Managing State in React 18** by Cory House.

This application shows how to handle complex state in plain React:
- Routing
- Error Handling
- Forms
- Context
- 3rd Party Libraries

### Structure
The folder **Rock Fitness Store** holds the source code of the final project.

The folder **Slides** has the course slides which covers the concepts and how the project was built from the ground up.
