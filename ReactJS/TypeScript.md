# Overview on TypeScript

TypeScript is highly-typed language for working with JSX. It actually focuses a lot on _types_ and is used best in those areas.

A TypeScript file is denoted by a `.tsx` extension.

## Setup

Setup a normal ReactJS project as you would, using Node and your preferred development environment like CRA or jScript.

When the application is setup, use the following to install yarn, a type of package manager like npm -> `npm install --global yarn`.

Finally, run the following within the root directory of the project to build the support for using TypeScript -> `yarn add typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-router-dom @types/node`.
