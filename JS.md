# Getting Started in JavaScript

## Environment
```Node.js``` and _Electron_ for local server development.

When running npm install, use it in the terminal because it is common to run into errors using VSCode's terminal.

Use ```npm install``` to build dependencies and push the project into a runable state.

Use ```npm run start``` to run the application.
